# Selection of testing library for unit test

## Decription

The testing frameworks are needed to test the project from unit, integration and e2e testing. We need to select the proper testing strategy for our project as that will conistitues  towards bigger technical debt in future. We need to have a easier testing strategy for unit test and integration test while for e2e test should be flexible with using the realtime api. 

## Decision
 
Although multiple testing frameworks are considered, it is decided to use the [jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) as our testing tools.
